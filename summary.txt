Beat Builder is a game where you build beats (attacks) and run those attacks along in parallel the more on beat the
rhythm of the attacks are the higher the score and off beat pauses are penalized with damage.
The player gets to use as many tracks of beats as their hands can keep up with and can pickup and drop tracks in intervals for bonus damage.
